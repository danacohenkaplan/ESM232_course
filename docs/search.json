A good model can help us to understand how the world works and\nhow decisions that we make might change the world in ways that are\nimportant to us. There are many different types of models, from simple\nto complex, and models are often tailored to answer a specific\nquestions. This course will give you skills that help you to choose\nwhich model, or modeling technique, is right for you - given the task at\nhand. The course will cover designing a new model and evaluating\nexisting models. We will emphasize best practices, such as sensitivity\nand uncertainty analysis, that help to design and use models to reliably\nsupport environmental problem solving. This is a skills based course and\nwe will use R (a data analysis and programming environment) as our basic\nplatform.\nClass will include a mix of lectures and in class hands-on examples,\nusing students’ own computers. I will often provide an R-markdown\ndocument for you to go through prior to class so you can learn at your\nown pace and we will then use class time for the hands-on examples and\nassignments.\n\n\nTeaching team\nInstructor: Naomi Tague (https://tagueteamlab.org/)\nOffice: Bren Hall 4516\nOffice hours: email to set a time\nEmail: tague@ucsb.edu\nTeaching assistant: Rachel Torres\nOffice: Bren Hall 1005\nOffice hours: T, TH 10:45-12\nEmail: ratorres@bren.ucsb.edu\n\n\nWhere we will be\nLectures: Tues, Thur 9:30am - 10:45 am (BH\n1414)\nMake-up Class May 9 5-8pm; May 10 5-8pm (BH\n1414)\nnote you only need to attend one of these - see sign up here\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nGain familiarity with different types of models and the\nsituations where you might use them\nUnderstand how to choose the ‘right model’ for the job\nKnow how to build simple models including\ninput-output models\nbasic dynamic models\nmatrix models\n\nGain some basic skills that are useful in applying models\nincluding\nparameter sensitivity analysis\nuncertainty analysis\nmodel calibration and evaluation\n\n\n\nComputing\nI will assume that everyone has some basic R skills (from ESM\n203, ESM 232, MEDS program courses or other courses), including how to\nuse ggplot, and Rmarkdown and build simple functions, as well as a basic\nunderstanding if git and Github\nMany classes will be working classes so bring these to\nclass\n\n\nTentative topics\n\nWeek\nLecture topics\nApril 17\nInto and Conceptual Models\nApril 24\nConstructing Simple Models in R\nMay 1\nSensitivity Analysis\nMay 8\nChoosing and Evaluating Models\nSpecial Class\nModel Calibration\nMay 15\nDynamic Models\nMay 22\nStability and Sensitivity with Dynamic Models\nMay 29\nMatrix Population (Discrete Dynamic)\nJune 4\nOptimization and Wrap Up\n\n\nAssignments\nThere are 8 assignments. Some assignments will be done in groups.\nAssignments will vary in length but most will be short coding\nassignments with a 1- paragraph write up. Assignments can be submitted\nas a link to your GitHub repository that has assignment files -\nthe link will be submitted on Canvas - that way we can keep\ntrack of grading for each assignment. If you find GitHub too\nchallenging then you can also submit files directly (if you do this,\nplease make sure you zip multiple files together)\n\n\nProtocols and Guidance\nLearning to program is hard and I may not always explain in a way\nthat is accessible to you - So if you don’t understand something\nASK\nideally ask in class - you will help me to learn how to explain (or\nfind an answer if I don’t know it) and you will help others\nif you don’t feel comfortable asking , reach out to me or\nRachel\n\nEnvironmental modeling and the coding involved gets better with\npractice and play - Don’t just read the Rmarkdown - try the code, try\nvariations on the ideas presented, make up stuff to try, get your feet\nwet\nProgramming means making mistakes, expect it, stay calm and try\nagain - if you get frustrated step away and come back; be\ncreative\nRespect and Support each other\nwhen working in groups, pay attention to your partner, if they are\nnot at your skill level, help them learn - recognize that we all have\ndifferent backgrounds\nlisten - different perspectives contribute to modeling - ask\nquestions; figure out how different people see the world (what\nis there conceptual model)\nyou learn by helping others - do that!\n\nIf you are really struggling, reach out to Rachel or myself, we\ncan help (or if you just want to chat about something )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  This website was made with distill by RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nNOTE: There are 10 toy Topic sections here, expecting that some teachers may want to have one page per week (for a 10 week course). You are encouraged to structure your course however works best for your class. All of your course information could be on a single page, or you might have a different number of topics, or organize weekly, or any other organization that works for you.\n\nTO UPDATE THIS PAGE: Open and edit the topic_1.Rmd file, in the project root, to delete this placeholder text and customize with your own!\n\nAdd a site page\nThe quick version:\nMake a new R Markdown document, save\nAdd the rendered .html to _site.yaml so the page exists on the site\nBuild to see updated site\nBelow for a bit more detail…\nMake each page an R Markdown document\nTo make a new page:\nWithin your website Project, create a new .Rmd (File > New File > R Markdown). Save it to the project root. For this example, let’s say you’ve saved it as new_page.Rmd.\nIn that .Rmd file, remove everything but the title (which you can change) from the YAML - that’s the top section of the .Rmd, where by default it has title, author, date, etc.\nUpdate the .Rmd to contain whatever you want to have on that page. Don’t know a lot about markdown? Considering switching over to the Visual Editor in RStudio (versions >= 1.4).\nSave the .Rmd\nAdd it to your navigation bar\nOpen the _site.yml file in your Project\nAdd the information to the YAML navbar section, which will almost always be the text that you want to appear in the navigation bar, and the file name of the knitted html that will be automatically rendered to /docs when you Build your website. That would be new_page.html for this example (since the .Rmd it is rendered from is new_page.Rmd). So in the _site.yml I would need to add this to the navbar section:\n    - text: \"A new page!\"\n      href: new_page.html\nNote: YAML is space & indentation specific. Follow the structure that already exists in this template to avoid YAML errors.\nHow is the website finding the html? Notice in the _site.yml file, the output_dir is set to docs. That means when we press ‘Build website’ (in the Build tab in RStudio), our .Rmd pages are knitted to HTML & sent to the _docs folder. This is also important because when we deploy the site (make it live), we will want to deploy from that docs folder using GitHub pages.\nTake a look at some other pages in this template (Resources, Assignments, etc.) to see the structure, & give it a shot!\nDelete/disappear a site page\nThe safest thing to do if you don’t want a page to show up is to remove it from the _site.yml navbar listings. That way, the material on the page still exists as a file in your project, but doesn’t show up on the website – don’t delete a page file unless you are REALLY SURE that you’re never going to want the material on that page ever again.\n\n\n\n",

I think most of them are most useful when you’re trying to make a finalized table with data in it, but if you really want to beautify your website tables there are options.\n\n\n\n",

Open it in your project, update the title and description fields in the YAML, save, then build your site (In RStudio: Build > Build Website) to see the updated title.\nThe label for the short link in the upper right of the page (right side of the navigation bar) is specified in the _site.yml page.

I can have it show up here by include a code chunk that looks like this:\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = \"80%\", fig.cap = \"USGS image of Mississippi River.\"}\n  knitr::include_graphics(\"img/usgs_sat.jpeg\")\n```\nWhich creates:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: USGS image of Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
