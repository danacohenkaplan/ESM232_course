# STEPS: Modeling for Problem Solving in ES

Clearly define your goal (a question you want to answer, hypothesis you want to test, prediction you want to make) - as precisely as possible

-   Design or Select your model

-   Implement the model

-   Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty

-   Apply the model to the goal

-   Communicate model results



#  Steps for Design and Implement your model 

* Diagram your model

* Translate diagram into a mathematical representation

* Choose programming language

* Define inputs (data type, units)

* Define output (data type, units)

* Define model structure

* Write model

* Document the model  (meta data)

* Test model

#  Building Models 

Modularity! (Functions)

The basic building blocks of models

Functions can be written in all languages; in many languages (object-oriented) like C++, Python, functions are also objects

Functions are the “boxes” of the model - the transfer function that takes inputs and returns outputs

More complex models - made up of multiple functions; and nested functions (and main functions that call/user other functions and control the flow - the arrows between boxes)


#  Modularity 
```{r, out.width = "25%",out.height="25%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/lego.png")
```




For each box/function Decide on 

 * Inputs and parameters

  * Outputs

Data types, units (time and space aggregation), names should be (use descriptive names)

**IMPORTANT**

Place each function in its own file (x.R), and put all functions for a given project in *R* subdirectory


#  What’s in the box 

Often more complicated than a simple single equation (regression results)

So we need to think through steps are - what is connected with what

Diagrams are a good place to start


#  Modularity - Discrete Tasks  

Hierarchical in level of details

Big chunks (coarse detail) -> progressively finer

Note ‘tasks’ that need to be repeated

All tasks should have inputs and outputs

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/model_basic.001.jpeg")
```



#   Composing Diagrams

Pictorial representation your model and what needs to be included in 
the model to answer your questions (or achieve your modelling goal)

There are many software tools available for generating conceptual models, I like

#  SERI-Fire 

* More complex model couple sub-models ( may be a loose coupling where users connects submodels)

* How do ecological and human factors interact to influence fire regimes

# Sharing Example R, Data and Rmarkdowns

[esm232_examples github site]{https://github.com/naomitague/ESM232_Examples_S24.git} 

You can clone this repository and then pull before class to get example code and data

Remember that git does not like having nested repositories - so
keep working respoistories in separate directories


# Running Models with Data

# Solar function example


**Design** -  function that estimates solar pv power given inputs of radiation

**Model inputs**: solar radiation (daily direct and diffuse)

**Model outputs**: power generated each year and average power over time

**Parameters**: panel efficiency, system performance, units, type of array (uses diffuse or not), plot Y/N

Some of these options such as whether to plot determine outputs from the function

AND the type of array to determine whether it uses diffuse radiation, 
these parameters change how the function/model works

# Solar function example as code (InformalSensitivity.Rmd)

Model Code

```{r solar, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

source("../R/solarpv.R")
solarpv
```

# Some Data

```{r}
# read in R formatted data
load("../Data/sierraczosolar.rda")

# already in the format required for the model
head(sierraczosolar)
```

# Run the model
```{r}
# run the model
solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W")

# run and save results - but don't plot
site1 <- solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = FALSE)
site1$mean
site1$annual
```

# Point of the model is to try different options/parameters/inputs


**Model inputs**: solar radiation (daily direct and diffuse)

**Model outputs**: power generated each year and average power over time

**Parameters**: panel efficiency, system performance, units, type of array (uses diffuse or not), plot Y/N

```{r}
# consider a different pv array that only uses
# diffuse and has non standard efficiency (0.6)
site2 <- solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = FALSE, eff = 0.6, etype = "direct")
site2$mean
```


# Informal Sensitivity Analysis

What happens when we vary parameters?

**Informal** - just try varying parameters

* decide  which parameter(s) and what range to vary the parameter over - what is the uncertainty? (+- 15% )?

* figure out how to efficiently run your model over parameter variation and save results as you go

* analyze the sensitivity (simply plotting for now)


# Helpful tools


* Sampling

    **runif**, **rnorm** (sampling from uniform and normal distributions)
    **seq** (for creating a sequence of numbers)
    
* Repeating 

  * in R - *purrr* package, also *apply* family of function
  
  * classic *for* loops
  
If you need it a good source to review working with *purrr* to extract items from list and repeat operations



[Useful Purrr Resource](https://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-19_purrr/)


  * we will start by using **map** - which "maps* a function (runs it ) for a list of values, we can
  also use these function to extract values from a list
  

# Rmarkdown code for informal sensitivity
```{r sen1, eval=T}
library(tidyverse)
# lets try informal sensitivity analysis again, this time by varying efficiency if we don't know efficiency exactly , lets try 20 samples

# use map from purrr
# notice how map adds the one parameter that is missing from the input list
eff <- rnorm(mean = 0.6, sd = 0.1, n = 20)
site2 <- eff %>% map(~ solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = FALSE, etype = "direct", eff = .x))

head(site2)
```

# Ways to look at results from an informal sensitivity analysis

* <span style="color: green;">Box plots or Violin Plots (where box shows parameter uncertainty)</span>

WHY: To see how big the range of output might be relative to "uncertain" parameter range

 
* <span style="color: green;">Plot Response against parameter value</span>

WHY: To see how the parameter influences the results

* <span style="color: green;">Average across parameter uncertainty</span>


WHY: If you want the one number that is the "best guess" given uncertainty

# Looks at some code

```{r sen2, eval=T}
# this is pretty messy - but we can extract a useful data structure,lets say we want
# just the annual data (not the mean annual time series), and then reformat as a data frame with nice column names
tmp <- map_df(site2, `[`, c("annual"))

site2df <- data.frame(year = tmp$annual$year, elect = tmp$annual$elect)
# get rid of that pesk first year

site2df <- subset(site2df, year > 1944)
# now we could plot
ggplot(site2df, aes(year, elect, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Electricity generated in W")

# we also might want an average across parameter uncertainty
site2_average <- site2df %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(elect = mean(elect))

# now add this to the plot - note that we remove the grouping by using group=1
ggplot(site2df, aes(year, elect, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Electricity in W") +
  geom_line(data = site2_average, aes(year, elect, group = 1), col = "orange")

# we could also plot how the mean annual electricity varies with efficiency (eff from above)
site2[[1]]

tmp <- map_df(site2, `[`, c("mean"))

# how variable is electricity generation (mean over all time) with uncertainty in solar efficiency

site2_mean <- data.frame(eff = eff, elect = tmp)
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Electricity in W")

# or to see what the sensitivity looks like
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(eff, mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Electricity in W", x = "Solar Efficiency")

# my best guess
mean(site2_mean$mean)
```



# In class practice

Try doing some informal  sensitivity analysis with your almond yield function

* what parameter might you vary
* how do you come up with samples across that variation
* how do you run the function across the samples
  * using **map** from **purrr*
  * are there other ways **for loops**...
