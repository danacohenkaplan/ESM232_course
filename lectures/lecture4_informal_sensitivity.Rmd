# What you can know about sensitivity before informal/formal sensitivity analysis

* Parameter interactions are *evident* in the equations

Recall our reservoir model

* **Input**: Reservoir height and flow rate

* **Output**: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

* **Parameters**: K (efficiency) , ρ (density of water), g (acceleration due to gravity)

P = ρ * h * r * g * K 

* P is Power in watts,
* ρ is the density of water (~1000 kg/m3)
* h is height in meters, 
* r is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
* g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s2, 
* K Efficiency is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1.

 <span style="color: blue;">
The "effect" of **K** (efficiency) will depend on the other parameters

 <span style="color: blue;">
A 1% change in **K** will lead to a 1% change in Power

 
<span style="color: blue;">
How much Power (magnitude) will change with an increase **K** will depend on value
of other parameters and inputs

 
<span style="color: blue;">
So you could say that Power is more sensitive to efficiency for larger flow rates or larger heights,
We know this because the are multiplied together!

# Some code to convince you of this

```{r simplex}
source("../R/power_gen.R")

Power_K1 = power_gen(height=2, flow=4, K=0.1, g=9.8)
Power_K1
Power_K2 = power_gen(height=2, flow=4, K=0.2, g=9.8)
Power_K2

# if you double K, you will double power (linear response)
# relative change in power
0.1*2

Power_K1*2

Power_K2/Power_K1


# but absolute change in power depends on other parmaters/inputs
# absolute change in pawer or magnitude of the change in power with change in efficiency (difference)
Power_K2-Power_K1

# if hieght is 3 instead of 2
Power_K1 = power_gen(height=3, flow=4, K=0.1, g=9.8)
Power_K1
Power_K2 = power_gen(height=3, flow=4, K=0.2, g=9.8)
Power_K2

# Power still doubles (relative change is the same)
Power_K1*2

# But absolute change is greater
Power_K2-Power_K1




```



# What you can know about sensitivity before "sensitivity analysis"

* when transfer function is linear (equation *tells* you what the sensitivity is)

* Imagine that habitat suitability for parrot can be modelled with the following equations, where

* **PS** probability that parrots will be found in a given location
* **P** is mean annual precipitation
* **T** is mean annual temperature
* $k_P$ and $k_T$ are empriically derived coefficients

 $$
 PS = k_P * P + k_T * T
 $$
 
 
<span style="color: blue;">
 Sensitivity to $k_P$ and $k_T$ will be linear
 
 <span style="color: blue;">
 Which coefficient will matter more?
 
 <span style="color: blue;">
*IF*  **P** and **T** where in the same units (e.g percent deviation from a mean value), then you could use
 the coefficients to tell you if parrot suitablity would be more sensitive to a 10% change in preciitation versus a 10% change in temperature
 


# What you can not know about sensitivity before "sensitivity analysis"

* Looking at the form of the equations in the box (transfer function) often tells you something about sensitivity


* BUT if you don't know what's in the box (transfer function) or if it has multiple boxes its difficult to tell

* any equation/transfer function with thresholds (if's, max, min's) hard to tell, sometimes parameters may 
matter sometimes they will not

* the first derivative of the equation with respect to the parameter IS the sensitivity; so if you can take the derivative you can *know* something about the sensitivity




# Building models with blocks - functions that call other functions


Functions can always embed other functions - and in models the output of one model may be the input to another

* loosely coupled models - output from one becomes input the other - but not necessarily automatic
* fully coupled - models exchange input and outputs (feedback systems)

Develop a flow diagram

```{r  out.width="75%", out.height="75%", echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
include_graphics("../img/power_comparison_figure.jpeg",) 
```

# Reusing boxes

To start - lets create what we need to compute net present value of power generated for multiple years 

* compute_profit_frompower.R

We will use output from our solarpv function as input into a function that estimates profit given a price - and also 'calls' another function to compute net present value

* compute_NPV 
    * inputs: value, time, discount rate
    
    * output  net present value of input value provide as some time in the future

* compute_profit_frompower
    
  * inputs: energy, year (energy was produced in) price, discount rate
  * outputs: single dataframe with columns for
    * energy
    * year
    * net (profit from energy in that year)
    * netpre (net present value of that profit)

```{r valuep}

source("../R/compute_NPV.R")
source("../R/compute_profit_frompower.R")

compute_profit_frompower

compute_NPV

# use solar from  site1 from above as input
head(annual_elect)

                                        year=annual_elect$year,
                                        price=30, discount=0.04)

profit_solar = subset(profit_solar, year > 1944)

ggplot(profit_solar, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+

```

# Putting it all together

Full picture of power options 

- run *compute_profit_frompower* for both hydro and solar power

- include sensitivity analysis to account for parameter undertainty in both 

Notice that we can 're-use' our functions such as *compute_profit_frompower* for both sources of power
(such as our reservoir power model) to build out our complete picture

# Why?

* Allows us to compare scenarios, accounting for parameter uncertainty 

* Illustrates a general workflow
    * design your model - reusing where possible
    * accounting for parameter uncertainty
    * graphing to analyze results

# Assignment 3
In your same groups - 

+ Develop a profit model for your almond yield (you can make this up - think about what the parameters would be) 
  * you might assume a baseline profit and then adjust according to the anomaly

  * there are many ways to combine the almond yield and profit functions; you can have the profit function "call"/use the almond yield function; or create a wrapper function that calls them in sequence (first the almond yield and then the profit function)

+ Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters

+ Create 2 graphs of the results - you can decide what is the most meaningful graph 

* Write a short paragraph (in the Rmarkdown document) to summarize you interpretation of your model results (e.g what do 'take away' from your model and sensitivity analysis)

Submit as a group: an Rmarkdown document, your R files for almond yield and profit model  on Canvas- 
Due Date Thursday April 18
