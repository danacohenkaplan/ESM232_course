# Mathematical Representation of this model

Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage

P = ET + ΔS

(at global scales ΔS includes streamflow since that water is still "stored" in the earth)

Water balance can tell you a lot

# Model Goals

Because models are only approximations of reality - the most important part of the modelling process is knowing **why** you want to build a model

Some broad types of goals

*Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)

*Estimation/Scenario* (what might be the consequences of decisions we make about the environment, what might the environment look like if something changes)

*Communication* - contribute to education and broader understanding

Actual goal(s) needs to be more precisely defined

# Models for understanding(big \#'s, little \#'s as controls on phenomena)

The is often the role of *inverse inference* models - for example using a GCM to assess whether CO2 emissions can explain trends in warming temperature

This application of models is often in the form of a question

In a particular place (Baltimore Harbor), would temperature often be a limiting factor in eutrophication? At what times of year, would N-export matter more or less?

# Modeling for Problem Solving in Environmental Science

-   There is something you need to know in order to solve the problem

    -   Answer to a question

        -   What if?
        -   How Much?
        -   Which Alternative?
        -   Why is this happening?

    -   Test a Hypothesis

# Modeling for Problem Solving in Environmental Science

-   Always start by clearly defining your goal as a questions (or hypothesis to be tested)

-   Examples?

# Models can also be for communication <Example:Glaciers>

Goal: Help public understand why, even if temperature warms - glaciers might grow (due to increasing snowfall) - but a threshold temperature might be reached where glacier will shrink

# Model Goals

*Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)

*Estimation/Scenario* (what might be the consequences of decisions we make about the environment)

*Communication* - contribute to education and broader understanding


# Conceptual Models

* models are **always** simplifications of reality - they help us to make sense of reality by focusing on specific aspects that are most relevant to your goal

* always start a modeling project by diagramming your conceptual model - how to you see the system; 
    * from here you design or choose your 'actual' model

* in a project, dialogue it is critical to dialogue to agree on the conceptual model

* "all models are wrong but some are useful" - British Statistician George Box



# Basic components of models

**Inputs** : Varying; think *x* of a *x* vs. *y* regression

**Parameters** : single values that influence relationships in the model

**Outputs** : what you want to estimate


# Simple model

**Input** : Change in unemployment rate

**Output** : Change in GDP

**Parameters** : Slope and intercept of the line

The US "changes in unemployment -- GDP growth" regression with the 95% confidence bands. ![](intro_lecture/assets/img/image7.png)


# STEPS: Modeling for Problem Solving in ES

Clearly define your goal (a question you want to answer, hypothesis you want to test, prediction you want to make) - as precisely as possible

-   Design or Select your model

-   Implement the model

-   Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty

-   Apply the model to the goal

-   Communicate model results


# Goals

The goal will help you to define the core pieces of a model

Often helpful to start at the end: Outputs

Problem: which piece of land should be purchased to maximize biodiversity?

Outputs: monetary costs and benefits of different options in 2015 dollars, including "non-market" benefits


# Goals

The goal will help you to define the core pieces of a model

Often helpful to start at the end: Outputs

Problem: how will forest carbon sequestration change if fire frequency increases with warming

Outputs carbon sequestration for different fire frequencies

# For Next Class


1. Fill out *Help us get to know you* survey on *Canvas*

2. Listen to *only* timestap 26:27 to 31:22  (basically 5 minutes) of the following blog by Lisa Felman Barrett - a highly cited psychologist

    * [blog  26:27 to 31:22](https://youtu.be/NbdRIVCBqNI?t=1587)

    * if you are interested you can learn
[More about Lisa Felman Barrett](https://www.affective-science.org/lisa-feldman-barrett.shtml)

    * Think about what an inverse inference problem might be in the context of the environment


3. After listening to the podcast, do the following

    a. Think of a conceptual model that you or someone else might use to understand some pattern that they observe in the environment (in other words a model that might help them to solve an inverse inference problem to understand the mechanisms that causes the observation)?
    
4. # This week's Discussion Section 

In this course, we will work a lot with writing and applying functions; You've all been exposed to writing functions in previous courses - but just to make sure that everyone remembers the basic syntax in R, complete the following:

    a. Write a function that computes energy produced from a photovoltaic system if you know the average annual solar radiation.  You can use the following formula: 

        $E = A * r * H * PR$
    
        * E is energy (kWh),
        * A is the solar panel area (m2)
        * r is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually around 0.2),
        * PR is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75) 
        * H is annual average solar radiation (kWh)


    b. Write your function in R; make sure that you add documentation; include default values for *r* and *PR* in the function definition; save the function in a single file to upload to Canva.


### To summarize, to submit on Canvas the following by 8am April 4th:

1. Fill out 'get to know you' survey on Canvas  
2. A single R file that implements the solar energy yield function (on Canvas)
(grading rubric to be presented in discussion section)

# Also be ready to discuss a conceptual model ideas in class
