## Discussion Section




What if we have a forest management task -  to make harvest a fixed amount of  carbon but only take it if forest carbon is above a threshold minimum carbon that will insure stability

Think about how you would explore stability here

* use our derivative function based on *dharvestfixed.R*

* assume a forest growth rate of 0.05, a carrying capacity of 1000kg and a harvest rate of 10kg/year

* can you figure out what the two stable values of forest carbon will be without running the ODE

## here's what I did  {.scrollable}

```{r stability}
source(here("R/dharvestfixed.R"))

# first lets look at how the derivative varies with the size of forest

carbon <- seq(from = 0, to = 1000)
dcarbon <- unlist(carbon %>% map(dharvestfixed, Time = NULL, parms = list(r = 0.05, K = 1000, mincarbon = 0, harv = 10)))

a <- ggplot(cbind.data.frame(carbon = carbon, dcarbon = dcarbon), aes(carbon, dcarbon)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "red") +
  labs(y = "Derivative\n (Rate of change of forest carbon) (kg/C/year)", x = "Current Forest Carbon Stock (kgC)")
a
# try it out with different initial conditions to watch how the system moves to a stable state
tm <- seq(from = 1, to = 500)
Pinitial <- 500
gps <- list(harv = 10, K = 1000, r = 0.05, mincarbon = 0)

res <- ode(Pinitial, tm, dharvestfixed, gps)
colnames(res) <- c("time", "carbon")

b <- ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Forest Biomass (kgC)", x = "Year", title = "Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 500kgC")
ggarrange(a, b)

#  try smaller starting condition
tm <- seq(from = 1, to = 500)
Pinitial <- 150
gps <- list(harv = 10, K = 1000, r = 0.05, mincarbon = 0)

res <- ode(Pinitial, tm, dharvestfixed, gps, method = "euler")
colnames(res) <- c("time", "carbon")

c <- ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Forest Biomass (kgC)", x = "Year", title = "Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 1kgC")

ggarrange(b, a, c)

#  try other stable starting condition
tm <- seq(from = 1, to = 500)

# unstable
Pinitial <- 275
# stable
Pinitial <- 277
gps <- list(harv = 10, K = 1000, r = 0.05, mincarbon = 0)

res <- ode(Pinitial, tm, dharvestfixed, gps)
colnames(res) <- c("time", "carbon")

ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Forest Biomass (kgC)", x = "Year", title = "Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 1kgC")

# try a different method
res <- ode(Pinitial, tm, dharvestfixed, gps, method = "euler")
colnames(res) <- c("time", "carbon")

ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Forest Biomass (kgC)", x = "Year", title = "Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 1kgC")
```
