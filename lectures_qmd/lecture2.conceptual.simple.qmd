# Model Goals

-   understanding

-   prediction

-   communication

You are doing this all the time - there are many reasons to make this process explicit (computer aided modeling)

Thought on inverse inference? Pair-Share your conceptual models?

# Conceptual Models

-   models are **always** simplifications of reality - they help us to make sense of reality by focusing on specific aspects that are most relevant to your goal

-   always start a modeling project by diagramming your conceptual model - how to you see the system;

    -   from here you design or choose your 'actual' model

-   in a project, dialogue it is critical to dialogue to agree on the conceptual model

-   "all models are wrong but some are useful" - British Statistician George Box

# Getting to a good conceptual model

-   Know what the goal is of your modeling project - precisely

-   Use that to decide what to include/exclude

-   Define inputs and outputs

# Some definitions

**Inputs** : Varying; think *x* of a *x* vs. *y* regression

**Parameters** : single values that influence relationships in the model

**Outputs** : what you want to estimate

# Simple model

**Input** : Change in unemployment rate

**Output** : Change in GDP

**Parameters** : Slope and intercept of the line

The US "changes in unemployment -- GDP growth" regression with the 95% confidence bands. ![](intro_lecture/assets/img/image7.png)

# Goals

The goal will help you to define the core pieces of a model

Often helpful to start at the end: Outputs

Problem: which piece of land should be purchased to maximize biodiversity?

Outputs: monetary costs and benefits of different options in 2015 dollars, including "non-market" benefits

Assumptions: non-market benefits are reflected by ..

# Goals

The goal will help you to define the core pieces of a model

Often helpful to start at the end: Outputs

Problem: how will forest carbon sequestration change if fire frequency increases with warming

Outputs carbon sequestration for different fire frequencies

Assumptions..stand-age versus carbon trajectories won't change with warming

# Conceptual Models

This is the **MOST** important step

-   Models are simplifications of reality

-   What processes in complex reality are your going to consider? why?

    -   Inverse Inference - you think this mechanisms, parameter, input leads to the response you are observing (understanding)
    -   You expect this process to be significantly influence outcome you are interested in (prediction)
    -   You want to "show" what influences an observation/prediction (communication)

-   Good question even for maching learning models - why?

# Conceptual Models

Things to think about

-   What inputs/parameters will influence how a process/mechanism leads to the outputs you are interested in

-   Can you measure those inputs/parameters? If not is there a proxy? Or another model?

-   Are there features of the environment that influence the relationship between input/parameter and output?

-   Are there inputs/parameters that you want to include to develop scenarios (things you'd want to 'change')

-   Time and Space (are you looking at a short or long terms behavior? do you care about spatial patterns? at what scale?)

-   What are some key assumptions?

# In Class

-   Form groups of 3
-   With your group, come up with a modeling goal related to some topic in environmental science
-   Decide if the goal is understanding, prediction or communication
-   Brainstorm on important
    -   inputs, parameters and outputs
    -   relationships/processes that need to be considered in the model
    -   assumptions

# Composing Diagrams

Pictorial representation your model and what needs to be included in the model to answer your questions (or achieve your modelling goal)

There are many software tools available for generating conceptual models, I like

\[Diagrams.net\]{https://www.diagrams.net/}

# Types of Model

There are many different ways to classify models

A *useful* classification looks at how models deal with space, time, and process

Useful because the *type* of model will have implications for how you *build* and *use/run* the model

# Stochastic - Deterministic

Stochastic: Model output is the probability of flood events of a magnitude greater than 500 m3/sec given rainfall probability distribution (artificial or generated from data) for a 100km2 watershed

Deterministic: Model output is the depth of flood given a rainfall event of 10cm over a 100km2 watershed

# Lumped …Spatially distributed

Lumped - single point in space, or space doesn’t matter

Spatially distributed - model is applied to different “patches” in space

-   spatial units are independent

-   spatial units interact with each other

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/spatial.001.png")
```

# Climate models are good examples

![](lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image3.jpeg)

Resolution matters for spatial models

# Static- Dynamic Time Varying

Static - Processes or Variables modeled do not evolve with time

Dynamic - model elements evolve through time - and variables/results at one time step typically depends on previous time step

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/temporal.001.png")
```

# Example of a time varying (dynamic) model

Modeling disease through time

[source](http://www.econometricsbysimulation.com/2013/05/sir-model-flue-season-dynamic.html)

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image13.png")
```

# Abstract - Physically/Process based

Abstract - relationship between inputs and output depends on parameters that don’t necessarily have a physical meaning - machine learning models are good examples

Physically based - parameters do have a physical meaning (could be measured) - relationships derived from first principles (theory) of how things work

Think...simple bucket model

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/image4.jpeg")
```

# Basic components of models

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture2.conceptual.simple/assets/img/model_basic.001.jpeg")
```

# How to start

-   What are your inputs-outputs

-   What’s in the box (the model itself) that gives you a relationship between outputs and inputs

-   Transfer function

-   Parameters, values that influences how the model relationships work

# Types of Models

Conceptual.............Mathematical

Stochastic.............Deterministic

Lumped.............Spatially Distributed: *SPACE*

Static.............Dynamic : *TIME*

Abstract.............Physically/Process Based

but biggest differences may often be the degree specific processes/parameters are accounted for

# Types of models: Example

-   Input: Reservoir height (height) and flow rate (flow)

-   Output: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

-   Parameter: Reservoir Efficiency (K)

Conceptual model

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture3_conceptualmodels2/assets/img/reservoir_cm.001.jpeg")
```

# Types of models: Example

-   **Input**: Reservoir height and flow rate

-   **Output**: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

-   **Parameters**: K Efficiency , ρ (density of water), g (acceleration due to gravity)

P = ρ \* h \* r \* g \* K Efficiency;

-   P is Power in watts,
-   ρ is the density of water (\~1000 kg/m3)
-   h is height in meters,
-   r is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
-   g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s2,
-   K Efficiency is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1.

This is a static (one point in time), deterministic, lumped (one place) model; its more or less physically based

# Types of models: Example

If we expand the model to output power production over a year, where inputs were streamflow for each day into the reservoir - *Dynamic Model*

If we expand to model power production from all the reservoirs in California, accounting for spatial patterns of snowmelt inputs and upstream-downstream relationships - *Spatially Distributed Model*

If we modified the model to estimate the probability distribution of power production, given a probability distribution of reservoir levels - *Stochastic Model*

# Assignment 2 - Conceptual Model

In a group of 2-3, think of a question (related to environmental problem solving) that a model might be useful for answering

-   Write down the question
-   List the key inputs, parameters and outputs (as precisely as possible, think about space and time)
-   Sketch the underlying conceptual model that would relate inputs/parameters to the outputs
-   Decide what "type" of model it is based on classification discussed today
