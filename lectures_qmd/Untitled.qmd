# Mathematical Representation of this model

Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage

P = ET + ΔS

(at global scales ΔS includes streamflow since that water is still "stored" in the earth)

Water balance can tell you a lot

# Model Goals

Because models are only approximations of reality - the most important part of the modelling process is knowing **why** you want to build a model

Some broad types of goals

*Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)
