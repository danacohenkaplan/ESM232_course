## Modeling for Problem Solving in ES

1.  Define your goal (question, hypothesis, prediction)
2.  Design or select your model
3.  Implement the model
4.  Evaluate the model and quantify uncertainty
5.  Apply the model
6.  Communicate results

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Off-the-Shelf Models

-   Developed and tested by experts
-   Reduces need to build from scratch

![Reinventing the wheel](img/two_prehistoric_women_reinventing_wheel.jpg)

## Model Selection

-   Is model structure **appropriate**?
-   Is model performance **good enough**?
-   Choose the **simplest** model that captures your processes of interest

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Selection: Is it Appropriate

-   Are outputs of interest captured? (e.g., streamflow, ET, N-export)
-   Is resolution appropriate?
    -   space
    -   time
-   Does it include key mechanisms?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Selection: Representation

Example - Will a fire in the upper watershed impact ET more than a similarly sized fire lower (nearer the stream) in the watershed?

## RHESSys

-   Includes evapotranspiration and links between upslope and downslope water availability to support it

## Model Selection: Representation

As trees age does "hardening" of the arteries - e.g reduced conductions of the xylem to water impact ET?

## Model Selection: Representation

Do autonomous vehicles reduce travel and environmental impacts? More precise questions - given trip demand from historic data - how many fewer cars are needed, what is the emission reduction due to more efficient cars?

![Model Overview](img/model_car.jpg)

## Model Selection: A more complex example

What will the impact of autonomous vehicles be on emissions and air quality in different cities (which will likely vary in adoption)

## Model Selection: Performance

-   Does it capture outputs accurately enough?

Examples from your experience?

## "Validation" or Is it Good Enough?

-   Error small relative to:
    -   Model application (why do you need the estimate)
    -   Simulated effect size
    -   Literature/state of the art
    -   Demonstrated improvement

## Validation: Types

-   **Reasonableness**: physical/logical checks
-   **Accuracy**: comparisons to observations

## Types of comparisons

-   Compare with:
    -   Thought experiments
    -   Physical constraints
    -   Other models
    -   Observed data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Thought Experiments/ Physical Constraints {.scrollable}

-   Conservation of mass, energy

-   Expected behaviors (zero rain = zero streamflow, no cars = no emissions, more fishing with everything eles the same, less fish)

-   Are output physically reasonable

    -   snowpack is not negative
    -   reservoir storage is always positive, less than reservoir capacity
    -   resulting biomass/size/height within known limits for that species
    -   household expenditures more than zero, less than highest income bracket

-   Are outputs consistent with known relationships

## Compare with Observations {.scrollable}

What observations?

-   local (ideal) - same place

But you often don't have data everywhere

-   similar context - similar locations
-   similar processes - same process in different locations

**Important** - even if it matches in the past, may not match in the future if something changes

Examples?

-   show model works across a range of conditions

*you might not always do this yourself, build on prior model applciations*

## Examples {.scrollable}

Does the model accurately capture the behavior you are interested in - in the context you are applying it

We want to estimate how streamflow will change in the next 10 years

-   **streamflow**
    -   compare to observed streamflow at gage at study site
    -   model applied and output compared observed streamflow from warmer, wetter, colder, drier locations
    -   look at how well model captures streamflow in wet and dry years

We want to estimate fish populations after a new policy is implemented that will change predation rates

-   **fish population**
    -   compare to observed population at study site
    -   model applied and output compared to observed populations in warmer and colder locations; high predation or low predation locations
    -   look at how well model captures population growth before and after predators introducted

## Example: RHESSys Validation

![RHESSys_pro](img/rhessys_val.png)

## Evaluating accurary

-   relative to your effect size (big or small)
-   relative to best available other option (other models?)

## Case Study: Santa Fe Water Supply

-   Threshold for buying water rights under climate change uncertainty

![sf](img/SantaFe.png)

Use a model to see if we should buy water rights now or wait And if vegetation management in water supply catchment would help

## Rhessys model estimates

## ![sfr](img/SanteFeModel.png)

## Model performance (measuring accuracy)

-   First Plot!

## Performance of What?

Similar to sensitivity of what? Extracting what is meaningful from the model

![hp](img/hydrographparts.png)

## Performance Metrics

-   **RMSE**, **Percent Error**

-   what others have you used?

## Streamflow data {.scrollable}

Lets start by looking at some data

-   **obsmm** is measured streamflow
-   **strmm** is simulated streamflow from a model

Both are daily data and normalized by watershed area (mm/day)

Date information is also included

Consider some different ways you can compare models and observed Graph! (what about yearly versus daily?)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
